## üí° **Overview of ResNet**

**ResNet** (Residual Networks) was introduced in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by **Kaiming He et al.** in 2015. ResNet's key innovation is the introduction of **residual learning**, which allows training of very deep networks by avoiding the vanishing gradient problem through **skip connections**.

The key idea is to learn the residual (difference) between input and output, instead of the direct mapping, which makes the training of deeper networks more efficient and effective.

## üöÄ **ResNet Architecture**

### **Basic Components of ResNet:**
1. **Residual Blocks**: Each block consists of two or more convolutional layers, where the input is directly added to the output of the convolution, bypassing one or more layers.
2. **Skip Connections**: These connections allow gradients to flow directly across layers, making deep networks trainable.
3. **Bottleneck Blocks (for deeper ResNets)**: These blocks are used in architectures like ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152, where the input is compressed and expanded to reduce computation and parameters.

### **ResNet Variants**:
- **ResNet-18**: Smallest ResNet variant with 18 layers. Ideal for quick experiments and small datasets.
- **ResNet-34**: Slightly larger, with more layers for better performance on standard datasets.
- **ResNet-50**: Uses **Bottleneck blocks**. Suitable for more complex problems.
- **ResNet-101**: Deeper ResNet with 101 layers. Best for highly complex problems.
- **ResNet-152**: The deepest ResNet, used for extremely complex problems and large datasets.

## üèÜ **Use Cases of ResNet**

ResNet is widely used across many **computer vision** tasks, including but not limited to:
- **Image Classification**: Classifying objects in images, typically using datasets like **ImageNet**.
- **Object Detection**: Using pre-trained ResNet networks as backbone feature extractors in networks like **Faster R-CNN** and **YOLO**.
- **Image Segmentation**: Using ResNet with techniques like **U-Net** for tasks such as medical image analysis.
- **Facial Recognition**: ResNet has been applied in facial recognition systems due to its robustness in identifying features.
- **Transfer Learning**: ResNet models are often used as pre-trained models, fine-tuned for specific tasks such as image classification or object detection.
